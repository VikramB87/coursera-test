    <div class="sectiontitle"id="section-title1">Shrivelfig</div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">The Shrivelfig is a magical plant, the best specimens of which are found in Abyssinia. The flowers of the Shrivelfig grow inside the fruit, both of which are purple in colour. It's a deciduous plant, meaning that its leaves start to shed in autumn, and the plant is leafless during winter. However, due to its aggressive roots, the plant can still survive even in snowy conditions. The leaves have medicinal properties. When skinned the fruit, which is actually the plant's flower and contains blossoms inside, produces a purple liquid with potion-making properties.[1] The ingredient can be purchased at the Apothecary in Diagon Alley for three Galleons.</div>

    <div class="sectiontitle" id="section-title2">Bubotuber</div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">A Bubotuber is a type of magical plant, the visible part of which is said to resemble a large, thick, black slug. This portion of the plant also squirms of its own volition. The surface of a bubotuber is covered in shiny protrusions, which when squeezed yield a thick, yellowish-green pus that has an odour akin to that of gasoline/petrol. It is unknown where the plant originates from, but is kept at the Hogwarts Greenhouses.</div>

    <div class="sectiontitle" id="section-title3">Gillyweed</div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">Gillyweed is a magical plant native to the Mediterranean Sea. When it is eaten by a witch or wizard, one grows gills and webbing between the fingers and toes, allowing them to process oxygen from water and navigate underwater more easily. There is some debate among Herbologists as to the duration of the effects of Gillyweed in fresh water versus salt water, [1] but the effects of Gillyweed in fresh water seem to last about an hour.</div>
